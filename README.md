# Data Layer

A modular, high-performance intermediate data layer for Node.js applications that seamlessly connects your NextJS frontend with multiple data sources including CMS, e-commerce platforms, and third-party services.

## Overview

This package provides a unified data layer that sits between your NextJS application and various external data sources, optimizing data fetching, caching, and delivery. Inspired by Gatsby's data layer architecture, it offers a plugin-based approach to data sourcing with intelligent caching and revalidation strategies.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Data Integration** - Connect to CMS (Contentful), e-commerce (Shopify), reviews (Okendo), and any other external APIs
- **Modular Architecture** - Plugin-based system similar to Gatsby's data layer for easy extensibility
- **Payload Optimization** - Intelligent data transformation to minimize response sizes
- **Smart Caching** - Built-in caching mechanisms with configurable strategies
- **Automatic Revalidation** - Handle data freshness with flexible revalidation policies
- **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support for better developer experience
- **Framework Agnostic** - Works with NextJS and other Node.js frameworks

## Installation

Installation and usage documentation will be provided once the API is finalized.

## Configuration

### Data Sources

The package will support configuration of multiple data sources through a plugin-based system. Each data source will be configurable with specific options and optional data transformation capabilities.

### Caching Configuration

Multiple caching strategies will be supported including in-memory, Redis, and file-based caching. Each strategy will have configurable time-to-live settings and revalidation policies.

### Node Extension

The data layer will support programmatic extension of data nodes, allowing developers to enhance and customize data structures with additional fields and computed properties.
