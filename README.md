# Data Layer

A modular, high-performance intermediate data layer that provides a unified interface for sourcing, caching, and transforming data from multiple sources. Built with a framework-agnostic core architecture, it uses adapters to integrate with any Node.js framework.

## Overview

This package provides a unified data layer that sits between your application and various external data sources, optimizing data fetching, caching, and delivery. Inspired by Gatsby's data layer architecture, it offers a plugin-based approach to data sourcing with intelligent caching and revalidation strategies.

### Problem This Solves

This data layer addresses critical issues commonly found in modern web applications:
- **Inconsistent Data Patterns**: Standardizes data fetching across projects
- **API Redundancy**: Eliminates duplicate API calls through intelligent caching
- **Performance**: Optimizes payload sizes and response times
- **Error Handling**: Provides centralized retry logic and fallback strategies
- **Type Safety**: Ensures consistent TypeScript types across all data sources

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Data Integration** - Connect to CMS (Contentful), e-commerce (Shopify), reviews (Okendo), and any other external APIs
- **Modular Architecture** - Plugin-based system similar to Gatsby's data layer for easy extensibility
- **Payload Optimization** - Intelligent data transformation to minimize response sizes
- **Smart Caching** - Built-in caching mechanisms with configurable strategies
- **Automatic Revalidation** - Handle data freshness with flexible revalidation policies
- **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support for better developer experience
- **Framework Agnostic Core** - Pure JavaScript/TypeScript core with framework-specific adapters

## Installation

Installation and usage documentation will be provided once the API is finalized.

## Configuration

### Data Sources

The package will support configuration of multiple data sources through a plugin-based system. Each data source will be configurable with specific options and optional data transformation capabilities.

### Caching Configuration

Multiple caching strategies will be supported including in-memory, Redis, and file-based caching. Each strategy will have configurable time-to-live settings and revalidation policies.

### Node Extension

The data layer will support programmatic extension of data nodes, allowing developers to enhance and customize data structures with additional fields and computed properties.

## Supported Data Sources

### Built-in Plugins

#### Contentful Plugin
- Supports all Contentful content types
- Automatic asset optimization
- Preview mode support

#### Shopify Plugin
- Products, collections, and customer data
- Webhook support for real-time updates
- Inventory tracking

#### Okendo Plugin
- Product reviews and ratings
- Customer testimonials
- Review aggregation

## Framework Integration

The data layer uses a framework-agnostic core with dedicated adapters for each framework, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maximum portability.

### Supported Framework Adapters

#### NextJS Adapter
- API routes with built-in caching
- Static site generation (SSG) patterns
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Server-side rendering (SSR) with optimized data fetching
- App Router and Pages Router support

#### Planned Adapters
- **Express/Fastify**: Middleware integration for REST APIs
- **Nuxt.js**: Module integration for Vue applications
- **SvelteKit**: Hooks and load functions
- **Remix**: Loader and action integration
- **Astro**: Integration for content-focused sites

## Performance Optimization

### Payload Optimization
- Automatic field selection to minimize response size
- Image optimization and responsive variants
- Compression for large datasets

### Caching Strategies
- **Memory**: Fast access, suitable for small datasets
- **Redis**: Distributed caching for scalable applications
- **File**: Persistent caching with minimal setup

### Revalidation
- **Webhook**: Real-time updates from data sources
- **Polling**: Periodic data refresh
- **Manual**: Programmatic cache invalidation

## Architecture

### Core Layer
The framework-agnostic core handles:
- Plugin management and lifecycle
- Data fetching and transformation
- Caching strategies and storage
- Query resolution and optimization
- Error handling and retry logic

### Adapter Layer
Framework-specific adapters provide:
- Integration with framework routing
- Request/response handling
- Framework-specific optimizations
- Developer experience enhancements

### Plugin Layer
Data source plugins handle:
- Connection to external services
- Data normalization
- Source-specific optimizations
- Webhook and real-time updates

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (Current)
- Framework-agnostic core implementation
- Plugin interface and lifecycle
- NextJS adapter as reference implementation
- Contentful, Shopify, and Okendo plugins

### Phase 2: Extended Framework Support
- Express/Fastify adapters
- Nuxt.js and Remix adapters
- Enhanced caching strategies
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Universal Data Layer
- Additional data source plugins
- GraphQL query layer
- Plugin marketplace/registry
- Advanced data transformation pipelines

### Creating Custom Plugins

The package will support custom plugin development to extend functionality for additional data sources and use cases.

### Testing

Testing documentation will be provided as the package develops.
