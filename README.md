# Universal Data Layer

A **Gatsby-inspired** unified data layer for modern web applications. This project aims to provide a plugin-based, framework-agnostic solution for managing data from multiple sources with intelligent caching and optimized payloads.

> ⚠️ **Early Stage WIP**: This project is in active early development. APIs and features are subject to change.

## The Idea

Modern applications often need to fetch data from multiple sources (CMSs, e-commerce platforms, APIs) with different patterns and authentication methods. This leads to:

- Redundant code across projects
- Inconsistent caching strategies
- Performance bottlenecks from unoptimized payloads
- Complex data transformation logic scattered throughout codebases

The Universal Data Layer solves this by providing a **single, extensible interface** that sits between your application and data sources - similar to how Gatsby's data layer works, but designed to be runtime-agnostic and work with any Node.js framework.
