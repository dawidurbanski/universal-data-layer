## Overview

The Universal Data Layer uses a plugin-based architecture that allows you to extend functionality and connect to various data sources. Plugins are modular packages that can be configured, registered, and loaded at runtime.

## How Plugins Work

Plugins in UDL follow a simple convention:

1. Each plugin is a package (npm package or local directory) containing a `udl.config.js` file
2. The config file exports plugin metadata and an optional `onLoad` lifecycle hook
3. Plugins are registered in your application's `udl.config.js` file
4. When the server starts, UDL loads and initializes all registered plugins

## Plugin Types

Currently, UDL supports the following plugin types:

- **`core`**: Core system plugins that provide foundational functionality
- **`source`**: Data source plugins that connect to external APIs or services (e.g., Contentful, Shopify, Okendo)

## Key Concepts

### Plugin Configuration

Every plugin has a `udl.config.js` file at its root that exports:

- **`config`**: Plugin metadata (name, version, type)
- **`onLoad`**: Optional lifecycle hook that runs when the plugin is loaded

### Lifecycle Hooks

The `onLoad` hook is called when a plugin is initialized. It receives a context object containing:

- **`options`**: Plugin-specific options passed during registration
- **`config`**: The application's UDL configuration

### Plugin Resolution

UDL resolves plugins in the following order:

1. **Relative/absolute paths**: If the plugin name starts with `.` or `/`, it's treated as a file path
2. **npm packages**: Otherwise, UDL attempts to resolve it as an installed npm package
3. **Fallback**: If resolution fails, UDL falls back to checking `node_modules` directly
