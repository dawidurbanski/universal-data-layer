## The Version Query

Every UDL server includes a built-in `version` query. This is the simplest way to verify your server is running:

```graphql
query {
  version
}
```

This returns the current UDL version string.

## Using cURL

Test the server from your terminal:

```bash [Terminal]
curl http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ version }"}'
```

You should see a response like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Using GraphiQL

For an interactive experience, open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:4000/graphiql
```

GraphiQL is a built-in IDE for exploring and testing GraphQL queries. Type the version query in the left panel and click the play button (or press Ctrl+Enter).

## Understanding the Response

GraphQL responses always follow this structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Query results here
  },
  "errors": [
    // Any errors here (only present if errors occurred)
  ]
}
```

The `data` field contains your query results, with keys matching your query field names. The `errors` field only appears when something goes wrong.
