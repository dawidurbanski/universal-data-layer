## Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental unit of data in the Universal Data Layer. Each piece of content from your data sources becomes a node with:

- **Unique ID**: Every node has a globally unique identifier
- **Type**: Nodes are strongly typed (e.g., `ContentfulProduct`, `ShopifyCollection`)
- **Fields**: Data properties specific to each node type
- **Relationships**: Links between related nodes

## Plugins

Plugins connect your data sources to the Universal Data Layer:

- **Source Plugins**: Fetch data from external APIs (Contentful, Shopify, etc.)
- **Transform Plugins**: Modify or enhance data during build
- **Schema Plugins**: Extend the GraphQL schema with custom types

## GraphQL API

All data is accessible through a unified GraphQL endpoint:

- **Auto-generated Schema**: Types are created from your data sources
- **Intelligent Querying**: Request only the data you need
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket subscriptions during development

## Caching Strategies

Multiple layers of intelligent caching:

- **Build Cache**: Persist data between builds for faster compilation
- **Request Deduplication**: Automatic batching of identical requests
- **Smart Invalidation**: Update only affected data on changes

## Coming Soon

- **Edge Deployment**: Deploy your data layer to edge functions
- **Custom Resolvers**: Create complex data relationships
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time updates from data sources
