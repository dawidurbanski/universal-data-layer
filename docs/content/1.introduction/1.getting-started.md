## Quick Start

The Universal Data Layer currently provides a GraphQL server with a simple API. Here's how to get started:

```bash [Terminal]
npx universal-data-layer
```

## Installation (locally, or globally with `-g`)

<code-group>

```bash [npm]
npm install universal-data-layer
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add universal-data-layer
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add universal-data-layer
```

```bash [bun]
bun add universal-data-layer
```

</code-group>


### Starting the Server

Once installed, you can start the GraphQL server:

<code-group>

```bash [npx]
npx universal-data-layer
```

```bash [npm]
# if installed globally
universal-data-layer

# if installed locally and added to scripts as "udl"
npm run udl
```

```bash [yarn]
# if installed globally
universal-data-layer

# if installed locally and added to scripts as "udl"
yarn udl
```

```bash [bun]
# if installed globally
universal-data-layer

# if installed locally and added to scripts as "udl"
bun udl
```

</code-group>

### Available Endpoints

Once the server is running, you'll have access to:

- **GraphQL API**: `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
- **GraphiQL Interface**: `http://localhost:4000/graphiql` (for exploring the API)

### Making Your First Query

The current schema provides a simple `version` query:

```graphql [query.graphql]
query {
  version
}
```

You can test it using curl:

```bash [Terminal]
curl http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ version }"}'
```

Or visit the GraphiQL interface at `http://localhost:4000/graphiql` to explore interactively.

## Using Plugins

UDL supports a plugin-based architecture for extending functionality. To use plugins, create a `udl.config.js` file:

```js [udl.config.js]
export const config = {
  port: 4000,
  plugins: [
    '@universal-data-layer/contentful',
    {
      name: '@universal-data-layer/shopify',
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.SHOPIFY_API_KEY,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Learn more in the [Plugin System documentation](/plugins/overview).
