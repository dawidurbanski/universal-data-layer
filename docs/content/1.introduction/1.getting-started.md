## Quick Start

The Universal Data Layer currently provides a GraphQL server with a simple API. Here's how to get started:

### Installation

You can install the core package or use it directly with npx:

```bash
# Install the package
npm install universal-data-layer

# Or use without installation
npx universal-data-layer
```

### Starting the Server

Once installed, you can start the GraphQL server:

```bash
# If installed globally or via npx
universal-data-layer

# With custom port (default is 4000)
universal-data-layer --port 8080

# If installed locally in a project
npx universal-data-layer
```

### Available Endpoints

Once the server is running, you'll have access to:

- **GraphQL API**: `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
- **GraphiQL Interface**: `http://localhost:4000/graphiql` (for exploring the API)

### Making Your First Query

The current schema provides a simple `version` query:

```graphql
query {
  version
}
```

You can test it using curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ version }"}'
```

Or visit the GraphiQL interface at `http://localhost:4000/graphiql` to explore interactively.

## What's Next?

This is an early-stage project in active development. The current implementation provides the foundation for a plugin-based data layer system. Future updates will include:

- Plugin system for connecting various data sources
- Caching strategies
- Data transformation pipelines
- Framework-specific adapters

For now, you can explore the GraphQL API using the GraphiQL interface and check the [project repository](https://github.com/dawidurbanski/universal-data-layer) for updates.
